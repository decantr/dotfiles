My Dotfiles
===========

Based on the voidrice dotfiles by Luke Smith (lukesmith.xyz) available
 from git.lukesmith.xyz/dotfiles

User will be asked if deploying to a HiDPi screen, it is worth noting that this
 causes issues with multimonitor displays and thus is not enabled by default.

The script creates a commit to the git repo that you should copy over to your
 $HOME folder ( with the command below ). This will allow you to run
 git status and git diff to ensure no local changes are clobbered.

Install
-------

To get the lastest changes just run
	$ sh change

Update
------

When you want to update it is advised to check for changed files in $HOME with
	$ git status -s --untracked-files=no
	$ git diff

Once you have backed up changes, simply run the `change` file again.
You will be prompted about changed files before any changes are made.

Notes
-----

to compile groff with images
	$ refer -PS -e $INPUT.ms | groff -me -ms -kept -T ps | ps2pdf - $OUTPUT.pdf
note the removal of the '-j' flag, this causes a hang with many .PSPIC elements
