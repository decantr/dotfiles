My Dotfiles
===========

Based on the voidrice dotfiles by Luke Smith (lukesmith.xyz) available
 from git.lukesmith.xyz/dotfiles

User will be asked if deploying to a HiDPi screen, it is worth noting that this
 causes issues with multimonitor displays and thus is not enabled by default.

Install
-------

To get the lastest changes just run
	$ sh change

To install/update
	$ cd "voidrice"
	$ rsync -a . ~

Notes
-----

to compile groff with images
	$ refer -PS -e $INPUT.ms | groff -me -ms -kept -T ps | ps2pdf - $OUTPUT.pdf
note the removal of the '-j' flag, this causes a hang with many .PSPIC elements
