My Dotfiles
===========

Based on the voidrice dotfiles by Luke Smith (lukesmith.xyz) available
 from git.lukesmith.xyz/dotfiles

If HiDPi mode is chosen, a number of changes are set, including larger font
 sizes wherever possible including vconsole and higher xrandr dpi.

The script creates a commit to the git repo that you should copy over to your
 $HOME folder ( with the command below ). This will allow you to run
 git status and git diff to ensure no local changes are clobbered.

Install
-------

To get the lastest changes just run
	$ sh change

Update
------

When running the install command, you will be prompted to view any changes that
 have been made to files.
You can then view all the new modifications about to be made, and any overwrites
 to temporary edits made.

Notes
-----

to compile groff with images
	$ refer -PS -e $INPUT.ms | groff -me -ms -kept -T ps | ps2pdf - $OUTPUT.pdf
note the removal of the '-j' flag, this causes a hang with many .PSPIC elements
